# Measuring preference without using a scale

This repository contains codes for fitting Diffusion Model for a paper ["Measuring utility with diffusion models"](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.adf1665z). 

As a research assistant, I led the entire process of implementing the Diffusion Model. My contribution includes: 

- Fitting the Diffusion Model to six datasets in Python using a Bayesian approach
- Conducting a thorough validation of Bayesian parameter estimation by examining posterior distributions, trace plots, and R hat values
- Providing parameter estimates for a figure in the main text and three supplementary figures
